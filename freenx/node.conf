# node.conf
#
# This file is provided by FreeNX. It should be placed either into
# /etc/nxserver/node.conf (FreeNX style) or /usr/NX/etc/node.conf
# (NoMachine NX style).
#
# It is mostly compatible with NoMachine node.conf.
#
# You surely are aware that FreeNX is based on the phantastic results that
# the hard work by NoMachine.com has achieved. NoMachine.com released the
# core NX libraries under the GPL. The installation of these libs are the
# precondition for all FreeNX scripts to work. If you are installing this
# software with the help of one of the package management tools of your
# Linux distribution, you can assume that this dependency is taken care of
# by the tool.
#
# You have questions about the inner workings of the NX technology?
#
# Then you are recommended to first check out the rich and very detailed
# NoMachine documentation and their online Knowledge Base at 
#
#           http://www.nomachine.com/kb/
#
# Other sources of information are the NoMachine mailing lists 
# (nxusers@nomachine.com and nxdevelopers@nomachine.com):

NX_ETC_DIR=/etc/nxserver
NX_SESS_DIR=/var/lib/nxserver/db

# Before turning logging on, please make sure that NX_LOGFILE is 
# writeable for the "nx" user
NX_LOGGING=0
NX_LOGFILE=/var/log/nxserver.log

# Authentication directives
# This adds the passdb to the possible authentication methods
ENABLE_PASSDB_AUTHENTICATION="1"

# This adds SSH to the possible authentication methods. For it to work sshd
# must be set up at localhost accepting password authentication.
ENABLE_SSH_AUTHENTICATION="1"

# This adds SU to the possible authentication methods. For it to work the 
# "nx" user must be in the wheel (RedHat, Fedora) or the users group (SUSE) 
# and the user logging in must have a valid shell that accepts the -c 
# parameter.
ENABLE_SU_AUTHENTICATION="0"

# Require all users to be in the passdb, regardless of authentication 
# method
ENABLE_USER_DB="0"

# When set to 1 this will automatically resume started sessions
ENABLE_AUTORECONNECT="0"

# When set to 1 this will automatically resume started sessions
# but only if an older client version is used

# When set to 1 exports NXUSERIP / NXSESSIONID in nxnode

EXPORT_SESSIONID="0"

# This can be set to any executable, which is started after session startup
# like: $NODE_AUTOSTART {start|restore}
NODE_AUTOSTART=""


# When those two lines are enabled FreeNX will automatically forward all
# connections to the commercial NoMachine nxserver installed on the same
# machine. This feature is introduced to enable the usage of FreeNX adn
# NoMachine NX side by side on the same machine without conflicts.
#
# To make a connection to the FreeNX server, just use 'freenx.<user>' as 
# username (where <username> is the existing Unix username. (You do not 
# need to create a user named 'freenx.<user>'!)
#
# To make a connection to the NoMachine nxserver, use the unmodified
# '<user>' username.

#NOMACHINE_SERVER="/usr/NX/bin/nxserver"

# When set to 1 will start nxagent in rootless mode.
